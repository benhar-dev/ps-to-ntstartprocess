## WARNING
This is a utility script which is a work in progress.  This may not produce usable code.  Please check all code which is produced before running it on a live environment. 

## Overview 
Quite often you will see me post solutions which use NT_StartProcess as a mechanism for holding and running powershell scripts without any external files.  This is the tool I wrote to help with that process.  

This is only a helper, and quite often I will need to create a TwinCAT safe powershell script first before running it through this.  

Things to be aware of
* Using double quotes in your powershell should be avoided.  These generated a large resulting string due to escaping and this is not fully supported.  Best to use single quotes and [char]34.  
* Just because it works in powershell does not mean it will work in TwinCAT.  Due to the lack of debugging support you may never find the reason for the code simply not working as expected.

## Getting Started
Open PowershellToNT_StartProcess.ps1 and change the $fileName to your powershell script (or use the example provided).  Run the script and see the resulting code.  This will also be copied to clipboard.
